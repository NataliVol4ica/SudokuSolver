# SudokuSolver
An app that is trying to solve a given sudoku in a human-understandable way.

**NO BRUTE FORCE.**

Project development can stop at any of these milestones:

1. console app can read sudoku from file and print console solution with solution steps on demand

2. app becomes asp.net core and does same job but now with normal UI.

2.1 app can allow user to enter sudoku and save it to a file from UI. It will verify if sudoku is valid and if it has any solutions

3. app becomes monogame

3.1 app works on android

File validation is not scheduled for specific milestone, as well as tests, so app is allowed to crash for invalid file format

High performance is not a goal (I will not fight for miliseconds, however 100sec is still too much)

##Ideas:

- support different types of sudoku (classic, XV, cages, etc)

- - how to read additional info from file?

- support custom rules

- support different sizes of sudoku

- support different forms of sudoku
